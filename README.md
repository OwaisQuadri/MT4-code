# MT4-code
Scripts and expert advisors created from scratch in the mql4 programming language for MetaTrader 4:

stoch : expert advisor that is based on a stochastic ocsilator and reversal dojis (was profitable but will not trade very often)
BUYSTOCK/SELLSTOCK: Script to trade stocks and forex currency using a buy/sell-stop that trades the correct volume of stock or currency pair based on the stoploss that you want to set, along with the risk that is intended on the account. the inputs are: pipsToStoploss (where the stoploss should be set), howFar (where the buy/sell-stop should be set), and forex (a boolean: if true, then the volume would be divided by 2)
